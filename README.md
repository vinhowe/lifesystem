> "I understand there's a guy inside me who wants to lay in bed, smoke weed all day, and watch cartoons and old movies. My whole life is a series of stratagems to avoid, and outwit, that guy." -Anthony Bourdain

This is a living catalog of various attempts by my better self to outwit my lethargic self. This idea is partially inspired by a [fantastic blog post](https://rs.io/core-human-values/) by Robert Seaton that examines how we are really multiple agents with different goals rather than one being with a single purpose.
