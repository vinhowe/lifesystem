# Tasks and their categories

#### 15-min: Make list of volunteer opportunities I'm interested in and determine how to decide which ones to do

This seems like a "to-do" item. Something I want to do, but that doesn't fit cleanly into any of my focus chunks. WoaH okay so maybe I could make a focus chunk for exploring interesting opportunities and only schedule it when there was something to explore on the list.

So it would be like a time when I could incubate ideas and decide whether or not to invest my time and focus into them. I could plan to schedule one of these per week or something. idk. I'll come back to this.

#### Determine when I can get running gloves

What I'm trying to do here is make a plan for getting the gloves. I don't have down who I'll talk to or where I'll get them, so this needs a few minutes to think about. This should be broken down into something smaller and more concrete--a "next action." This vague task is the kind of thing that sticks around in my inbox forever until I give up on it.

But this is kind of a mini-project in itself. If we're using the idea of atomic tasks, even something as simple as getting running gloves could be broken down into multiple, more actionable steps. Let's look at how we might do that.

First, make a project and set a deadline:

`project create buy running gloves due:1 week` **(Maybe I can use TaskWarrior's date parsing algorithm)**

#### Look at volunteer opportunities email

This is bad, because _there is no objective._ What is the output of this task? What should I have when I'm done that I didn't when I began?

A better way to attack this might be: "Look at each of the opportunities in the volunteering email and make a list of any of them that I'm interested in."

But what do I do after this point? Also, where does this list go? Into some kind of reference? How do I make sure that I'll do something more with this list? If I can't be sure that I'll remember the list later, then I'll end up trying not to forget it until I can sit down with it.

That's the thing. I need to have a guarantee that I'll have a chunk of time to evaluate them at some point in the future. Say, 15 min. The input is this list, and the output is... what? That I've which opportunity to sign up for? That I've called them and signed up?

Maybe I need to follow the same project approach I took with the running gloves.

_I start off with an orphan task:_

* 15 min: decide if I want to do any of the volunteering opportunities in the email from VolunteerMatch

_I click through to the listings that seemed relevant (there's something about comforting women who have been abused, but I neither want to do that, nor am I likely the right person). I find something about helping at the Relay for Life. That looks like fun, but it's on a Saturday a month out, and I don't know if my family is doing anything then. So I text my mom. She doesn't say anything, so I make a new task:_

* Follow up with Momma about whether or not I can do the Relay for Life on the 61st

Does this end up following the project approach? Especially because my objective changes from "Decide if I want to do anything" to "Sign up for this one thing." It seems like, if it were an option, it would just be easier for me to treat these two tasks as unrelated. There really doesn't seem to be a lot of value added in sticking them into a project.

It makes sense to create a project with a deadline when I'm taking an existing objective and breaking it down into smaller tasks, but less sense when I'm exploring something and the objective is only defined after reaching a conclusion that could span across several different time chunks.

Do I need another concept just for this kind of open-ended research? It seems like I start looking at options and then create a project _if_ I want to do something.

```
options/ideas --> research (over one or more time chunks) --> either a project or nothing
```

I think this is good. The way I'm thinking about doing it now is to have an abstract task list type with "project" and "research" as implementations. I don't know how I'll work focus tasks into this.

ONWARD!

#### Find list of apartments south of campus, then call them and ask when they start filling up for Fall

This would be part of a project. My objective is to get a place to live in the Fall. I could set a definite deadline for when I wanted that to happen, and create a list of tasks that need to be completed in order for that to happen.

This seems to fit really well with the model I have for projects. Just as long as I'm taking a bigger objective and atomizing it.

#### Cash check 10863

This is an orphan task. This needs no follow-up and has no precedent--except that I cash checks weekly, so it could be considered a recurring orphan task.

I haven't worked out how I'd get recurrence to work on a technical level yet. But during scheduling, every available task should be ordered by an urgency score based on priority (how is this determined?? is this something I have to come up with every time I make a task?) and due date.

Maybe I need "recommended entry points" for to-dos. I say "recommended" because there's nothing stopping me from doing whatever I want whenever I want, so my application should help me make good time decisions instead of blocking me from making bad ones. Especially if there's an edge case where I really do need to do something outside of the ordinary.

#### Read and take notes on The Family: A Proclamation to the World

Effort that could extend over multiple sessions over days or weeks. Uses one note.

#### Let BYU Y know I messed up a digit of my SSN

1 session. Basic standalone task. Can show notes. 

#### Make list of ways to study better in Dynalist from "Study Less, Study Smart" summary on Lifehacker

Could be multiple sessions. Might not need to save document, since output is being captured elsewhere.

#### 15-min: Think of ways to do something for someone else every day

1 session min. Notes.

#### 15-min: Beliefs, Principles, Rules and Positions could be built to use a better system with versioning, related experiences and a spiffy mobile app

Possibility for multiple sessions. Needs document.

#### 15-min: Make determinations about graduate school

Possibility for multiple sessions. Needs document and Decisions.

#### 15-min: Explore options for making sure I'm doing enough things to be a good (and interesting) candidate for grad school

Likely multiple sessions over several months. Notes.

#### 15-min: Research eating ideas and add to eating list

Possibility for multiple sessions. Notes.

#### 15-min: Create plan for long-term reviews

Possibility for multiple sessions. Notes.

#### 15-min: Make simple, easy framework for principle reviews

Possibility for multiple sessions. Notes.

#### Create income plan

Likely multiple sessions. Document is not likely to be expressive enough.

#### Buy chain, plywood board and carabiner clip

One session.

#### Come up with lunch ideas for college eating list

Possibly multiple sessions. Notes required.

#### Copy Sonata Pathetique

One session. Notes unlikely.

#### 15-min: My actions are more motivated by how I feel in the moment than by a strong moral center

Really an issue session.

#### Review and scheduling

Should either be implemented in the system, or scheduled using another service.

#### Check if CS 142 has time and place

One session. Short note, probably.
